# Practical Data Science - Final Project

*Project description:*

**Predicting wine quality from its physiochemical characteristics:**

Is there such a thing as a good wine and a bad wine? Many people think that, excluding particularly bad vinegar-like wines, there isn't much difference between your €15 and your €60 bottle. Blind wine tasting have cast much doubts on the ability of regular people and professional someliers alike to distinguish between wines of different quality.

With this dataset, we are trying to score wine quality based on objective physical and chemical characteristic of the beverage by the use of Machine Learning (ML) models. Thus, we have predicted the quality of wine on the basis of given features. The dataset has the fundamental features which are responsible for affecting the quality of the wine. Here, we will be dealing with the red type (wine sample from Portugal) wine quality, applying both regresion and classification techniques, testing if it is good or bad.
